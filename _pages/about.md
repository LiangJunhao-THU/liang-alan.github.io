I am a 3rd year Ph.D. Candidate advised by [Lingjie Kong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9ZZVgx4AAAAJ&hl=en) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research mainly focuses on **computational pathology**, especially using deep learning methods to find new cancer biomarkers, acquire low-dimensional knowledge from high-dimensional pathological images, and develop clinically useful framework for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In addition, I also study **computational optics** and develop histopathological optical imaging systems, which combine medical prior information and special optical methods to achieve clinically usable intraoperative rapid diagnosis and prognosis.
